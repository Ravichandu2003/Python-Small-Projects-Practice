# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The user selects a range, and the computer picks a random number within that range. The goal is to guess the correct number in the fewest attempts possible.

## Project Overview
This beginner-friendly project is designed for those who are new to programming. It provides a hands-on introduction to the concept of binary search and basic game development using Python.

## How It Works
1. The user sets the lower and upper bounds of the range.
2. The computer generates a random number within that range.
3. The user has to guess the number. After each guess, the computer provides feedback:
   - "Too high!" if the guess is greater than the random number.
   - "Too low!" if the guess is less than the random number.
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed or all attempts are used.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed.

### Running the Game
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Number-Guessing-Game.git](https://github.com/Ravichandu2003/Python-Small-Projects-Practice/blob/ae7101fe5bc44fe948c04df2824a4a0cbd6b518e/GuessingNumber/GuessingNumber.py
