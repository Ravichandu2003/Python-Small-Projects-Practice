# #String concatenation (combining of two strings)
# #As an example if we want to combine strings that says "This is a code for _______" with blank = "Madlibs" then 
# blank = "Madlibs"

# #we have few ways to concatenate
# print("This is a code for " + blank)
# print("This is a code for {}".format(blank))
# print(f"This is a code for {blank}")
